# Developer Feedback

This project had the potential to be a great idea, but I faced some blockers that prevented its completion. So, I decided to save the idea for the next hackathon and share my developer feedback with the Avail team instead.

My plan was to build a Rollup chain using Arbitrum Orbit Chains, which can integrate with Avail DA through various configurations. Unfortunately, I ran into issues with the orbit-setup-script Docker container and didn’t have enough time to resolve them. Here's an overview of the steps I managed to complete for the project:

1. Installed the required components: Docker Compose, Foundry, and SubWallet.
2. Obtained testnet ether for Arbitrum Sepolia.
3. Downloaded the avail-nitro-node Docker image.
4. Deployed Rollup contracts.

The last step `Spinning up the chain using the orbit-setup-script` was where I got stuck due to errors in the Docker images. Despite this, I’m optimistic about making it work in the future.
